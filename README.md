Project Title: 
# Hierarchical temporal memory (towards Musical Generation)

# Project Description: 

I studied Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) to store and generate musical sequences. 

Hierarchical temporal memory are networks whose nodes called neurons can memorise a simple piece of information. As a sequence is submited to the network, its configuration evolves to store the information about this history enabeling the network to give prediction about the next elements of the sequence. In this project I worked on implementing in Wolfram Language a representation of the network and figure out the rule of its evolution to memorize sequence and generate new events.

I also started to implement an interactive, musical keyboard interface. It is able of producing and of the musical styles built into the Wolfram Language in any specified pitch simply by just clicking on the desired key.

In using this keyboard, there are three parameters one can manipulate:
1. Number Of Octaves: One can construct a keyboard ranging from one octave long to seven octaves long, the size of a full piano!
2. Label Visibility: One always has the option of showing or hiding the pitch labels so that you can always see the names of the keys.
3. Instrument (Musical Style): In the Wolfram Language there are 128 different styles that ranging from very common instruments such as the guitar, piano, or violin, but you also have access to less common instruments like the Pan Flute, the Harp, or a Xylophone, and then there are really weird sounds like Gunshots, and telephones and even Oohs and AAhs which can all be played in any pitch with this keyboard in a very simple and intuitive manner.
