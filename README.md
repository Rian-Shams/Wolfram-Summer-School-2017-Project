Project Title: 
Symbolic Hierarchical Temporal Memory

Project Description: 

When you looks at a human brain, the first thing you notice is that its outer surface resembles a pinkish gray cauliflower. This visible outer surface is called the neocortex, or cortex for short. Almost all intelligent activity ranging from making predictions, to discovering facts, to shaping reality, to developing analogies, to imagination occurs in the cortex. 

Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a theoretical framework designed with two parallel goals in mind. The first is to obtain a deeper understanding of how the neocortex processes sensory input. The second is to translate this knowledge into general, flexible machine learning algorithms. 

The goal of my project is to implement a subset of this theory which is called Sequence Memory in the Wolfram Language. 

Sequence Memory is a novel approach to sequential machine learning. It is very flexible because of its ability to learn, recall and predict future values in a sequence regardless of:
  
  1. Sequence Type - Elements in the sequence can be symbols, numbers, musical notes, vectors, or even other sequences.
  2. Sequence Length - A sequence may vary from very few to very many elements.
  3. Sequence Complexity - Complexity is defined as the number of distinct or unique contexts of elements in a sequence.
